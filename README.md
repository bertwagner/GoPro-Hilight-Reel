# GoPro HiLight Reel

This script takes a folder of GoPro videos tagged with [HiLights (tags)](https://gopro.com/help/articles/Question_Answer/What-is-HiLight-Tagging-and-How-Does-it-Work) and automatically edits them into a single video, trimming the videos X seconds before and Y seconds after each HiLight tag.

The purpose of this script is to automatically edit my volleyball game footage in order to be able to watch and learn (and laugh) at highlights.  A more detail write-up of how it works can be found at [bertwagner.net]](https://bertwagner.net/2019/03/28/automatically-editing-lengthy-video-footage/).
